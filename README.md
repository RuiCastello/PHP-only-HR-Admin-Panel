# PHP-only-HR-Admin-Panel
**Add/remove/edit employees, set/edit salaries, set roles, etc.**

<br />

- Created with PHP and MySQL as an exercise to expand my vanilla PHP skills.  
- My focus here was just on logic, didn't spend much time on prettifying the ui, for that I have other front-end projects in angular and react.
